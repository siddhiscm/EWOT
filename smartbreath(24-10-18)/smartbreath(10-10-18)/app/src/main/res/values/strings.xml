    <string name="drs">Basic Training Protocol \n\n \t\t\t This protocol is inspired by Phil Campbell’s
        Interval Training Model. It stimulates HGH and EPO by utilizing simultaneous hypoxia and hypoglycemia,
        separated by hyperoxia. This protocol can help you:
        \n•	Improve your VO2 max
        \n•	Stimulate HGH
        \n•	Stimulate EPO
        \n•	Reduce Inflammation

    <string name="protocol2">Advanced Training – Pre Performance Protocol:\n\n \t\t\t
        This protocol is designed to maximise your blood oxygen levels in preparation for aerobic athletic performance. It further prepares you by:
        \n • Opening your body’s capillaries for optimal blood delivery to muscles.
        \n •	 Restoring blood flow to muscles likely inhibited by prior training or aerobic performance.
       \n\n \t\t\t\t\t "TotalDuration ":" 12 - 18 Mins"</string>
    <string name="protocol3">Advanced Training – Post Performance Protocol: \n\n \t\t\t Use this protocol after
        your workout or after athletic performance to clear metabolic waste and restore blood flow. This protocol
        usually cuts normal recovery time in half by :\n •Clearing inflammation which hinders recovery. \n
        • Restoring blood flow to traumatized tissues to enable healing.
        \n\n \t\t\t\t\t "TotalDuration ":" 14 – 20 Mins"</string>
    <string name="protocol4">High Altitude Training – Recovery Protocol:\n\n \t\t\tThis protocol presumes
        that you are at altitude and are having altitude related discomfort. Your discomfort likely reflects
        inflammation from hypoxia. Follow the below protocol to reduce the inflammation and ease your discomfort.
        \n\n\t\t\t\t\t "TotalDuration ":" 18 - 34 Mins"</string>
    <string name="protocol5">High Altitude Training – Preparation Protocol: \n\n \t\t\t
        It is important to prepare your body before trying to perform at High Altitudes.
        The following protocol will assist with the preparation by: \n
        • Creating more RBC (Red Blood Cells).\n
        • Improving lung function. \n \n\t\t\t\t\t "TotalDuration ":" 23 - 29 Mins"</string>
    <string name="protcol6">Metabolic Training – Brain Oxygenation Protocol: \n\n \t\t\t
        This protocol is designed to restore oxygen to the head to help resolve inflammation in the brain, eyes and ears.
        Many conditions involve inflammation in these areas, such as: \n \n
        • Tinnitus – inflammation in the auditory processing of the inner ear.
        \n\n \t\t\t\t\t "TotalDuration ":" 16 - 22 Mins"
